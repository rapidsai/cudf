description: Use this skill to review GitHub pull requests for cudf
---

Use this skill when the user invokes `/review-cudf` with:
- a cudf GitHub PR link
- currently checked out cudf PR
- specified cudf code changes or a diff

cudf GitHub repository is located at: https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf

# Review cuDF Pull Request

1. **Fetch PR metadata and diff**

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo rapidsai/cudf --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,baseRefName,headRefName
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --repo rapidsai/cudf
```

Hint: Check if `GH_TOKEN` (or GitHub CLI auth) is already configured in the environment (for example via your secret manager) so `gh` can authenticate and bypass rate limits; do not run `gh auth token` from within the agent. If `gh` auth is unavailable, fall back to GitHub's raw diff/patch URLs, `git fetch` of the PR ref, unauthenticated GitHub REST API with `curl`, or any other available methods.

2. **Fetch review comments already posted** for context on what's already been suggested and need not be repeated.

3. **Read the Developer Guide** (`cpp/doxygen/developer_guide/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`) — it is the authoritative reference for libcudf conventions. All rules in the guide apply during review. The checklist below calls out the most review-relevant rules and adds items **not** covered by the guide.

4. **Analyze the changes** against the checklist below, reading relevant source files as needed for context.

5. **Produce a structured review** using the output format at the bottom.

6. **Dump the structured review** to `.agents/reviews/<PR_NUMBER>/review.md`

## Review Checklist

For the detailed review checklist, read these files:
- **C++/CUDA**: `cpp/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Python**: `python/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Developer Guide**: `cpp/doxygen/developer_guide/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- **Testing Guide**: `cpp/doxygen/developer_guide/TESTING.md`
- **Benchmarking Guide**: `cpp/doxygen/developer_guide/BENCHMARKING.md`
- **Documentation Guide**: `cpp/doxygen/developer_guide/DOCUMENTATION.md`

Use all applicable checklist items from those files when reviewing the PR. The Developer Guide is the authoritative reference for libcudf conventions — all rules in the guide apply during review.
