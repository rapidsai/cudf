nvCOMP Integration
=============================

Some types of compression/decompression can be performed using either the `nvCOMP library <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcomp>`_ or the internal implementation.

Which implementation is used by default depends on the data format and the compression type.
Behavior can be influenced through environment variable ``LIBCUDF_NVCOMP_POLICY``.

There are three valid values for the environment variable:

- "STABLE": Only enable the nvCOMP in places where it has been deemed stable for production use.
- "ALWAYS": Enable all available uses of nvCOMP, including new, experimental combinations.
- "OFF": Disable nvCOMP use whenever possible and use the internal implementations instead.

If no value is set, behavior will be the same as the "STABLE" option.
