Welcome to cuDF's documentation!
=================================

cuDF is a Python GPU DataFrame library (built on the `Apache Arrow
<http://arrow.apache.org/>`_ columnar memory format) for loading, joining,
aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data. cuDF also provides a
pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers & data scientists, so
they can use it to easily accelerate their workflows without going into
the details of CUDA programming.
