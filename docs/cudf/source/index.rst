**cuDF** (pronounced "KOO-dee-eff") is a Python GPU DataFrame library (built
on the `Apache Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/>`_ columnar memory format)
for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data.
cuDF also provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers
& data scientists, so they can use it to easily accelerate their workflows
without going into the details of CUDA programming.

``cudf.pandas`` is built on cuDF and accelerates pandas code on the
GPU.  It supports 100% of the pandas API, using the GPU for
supported operations, and automatically falling back to pandas for
other operations.
