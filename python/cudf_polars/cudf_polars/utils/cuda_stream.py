    Get a joined CUDA stream with safe stream ordering for deallocation of inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    get_cuda_stream
        A zero-argument callable that returns a CUDA stream.
    upstreams

    Yields
    ------
    A CUDA stream that is downstream of the given streams.

    Notes
    -----
    This context manager provides two useful guarantees when working with
    objects holding references to stream-ordered objects:

    1. The stream yield upon entering the context manager is *downstream* of
       all the input streams.  This ensures that you can safely perform
       stream-ordered operations on any input using the yielded stream.
    2. The stream-ordered CUDA deallocation of the inputs happens *after* the
       context manager exits. This ensures that all stream-ordered operations
       submitted inside the context manager can complete before the memory
       referenced by the inputs is deallocated.

    Note that this does (deliberately) disconnect the dropping of the Python
    object (by its refcount dropping to 0) from the actual stream-ordered
    deallocation of the CUDA memory. This is precisely what we need to ensure
    that the inputs are valid long enough for the stream-ordered operations to
    complete.
