    Decompose a multi-partition Select operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    select_ir
        The original Select operation to decompose.
        This object has not been reconstructed with
        ``input_ir`` as its child yet.
    input_ir
        The lowered child of ``select_ir``. This object
        will be decomposed into a "partial" selection
        for each element of  ``select_ir.exprs``.
    partition_info
        A mapping from all unique IR nodes to the
        associated partitioning information.
    config_options
        GPUEngine configuration options.
    stats
        Statistics collector.

    Returns
    -------
    new_ir, partition_info
        The rewritten Select node, and a mapping from
        unique nodes in the new graph to associated
        partitioning information.
