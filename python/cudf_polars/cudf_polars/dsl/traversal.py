    Unique nodes in the expression, parent before child, children

    Notes
    -----
    This can be used as a generic "base case" handler when

    Existing node `e` if transformed children are unchanged, otherwise

    No-op wrapper for recursive visitors.

    Facilitates using visitors that don't need caching but are written
    in the same style.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn
        Function to transform inputs to outputs. Should take as its
        second argument a callable from input to output.
    state
        Arbitrary *immutable* state that should be accessible to the
        visitor through the `state` property.

    Notes
    -----
    All transformation functions *must* be free of side-effects.

    Usually, prefer a :class:`CachingVisitor`, but if we know that we
    don't need caching in a transformation and then this no-op
    approach is slightly cheaper.

    Returns
    -------
    Recursive function without caching.

    Caching wrapper for recursive visitors.

    Facilitates writing visitors where already computed results should

    ----------
    fn
