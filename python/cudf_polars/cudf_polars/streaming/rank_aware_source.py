class SizedChunks:
    """
    An iterator that also reports how many chunks it will produce.

    A Polars IO source returns an iterator, so the total number of chunks is
    generally unknown until the iterator is fully consumed. When a source already
    knows its chunk count, wrapping the chunks in `SizedChunks` lets the
    cudf-polars streaming engine forward chunks lazily, keeping only a single
    device chunk resident at a time instead of materializing all chunks up front to
    learn the count.

    `SizedChunks` remains an ordinary iterator, so the default (host) Polars
    engine handles it unchanged.

    This is an interim cudf-polars API. It exists because Polars' IO-source
    contract returns a plain iterator with no length. It may be removed if Polars
    exposes a supported way to report the chunk count. Tracked in
    https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/22917.

    Parameters
    ----------
    count
        Number of chunks ``chunks`` will yield.
    chunks
        Iterable of host :class:`polars.DataFrame` or GPU-resident
        `cudf_polars.containers.DataFrame` chunks.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import polars as pl
    >>> from polars.io.plugins import register_io_source

class RankAwareSource(abc.ABC):
    """
    Base class for rank-aware Polars IO-plugin sources.

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`__call__`, which follows the standard
    Polars `io_source` contract with additional `rank` and `nranks` keyword
    arguments supplied by cudf-polars streaming engines.

    During multi-rank streaming execution, every rank calls the IO source once.
    The implementation should therefore use `rank` and `nranks` to produce the
    rank-local rows of the global dataframe.

    This is an interim cudf-polars API. It exists because Polars' IO-source
    contract has no way to thread rank information into a source. It may be
    removed if Polars exposes a supported mechanism. Tracked in
    https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/22917.

    The `rank` and `nranks` arguments default to `0` and `1` for the in-memory
    cudf-polars engine, the default Polars engine, and single-rank streaming.

    A single `RankAwareSource` instance may be invoked concurrently (the same
    source can appear in more than one scan of a query, and the streaming engine
    runs scans on separate threads). Implementations must therefore be safe to
    call concurrently.

    Pass the `RankAwareSource` instance directly to `register_io_source`; do not
    wrap it in another callable. To inject rank information, cudf-polars must
    locate the `RankAwareSource` instance inside the registered callable. Only an
    unwrapped instance is recognized; wrapping it in anything else (a
    `functools.partial`, closure, lambda, or decorator) hides it, in which case
    the source is treated as rank-unaware and runs on rank 0 only. This
    limitation is tracked in https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/22917.

    Examples
    --------
    Register a source that stripes a shared frame across streaming ranks.

        Produce the rank-local chunks of this IO source.

        Parameters
        ----------
        with_columns
            Projected column names. If not ``None``, the source should return
            only these columns.
        predicate
            Polars expression. The reader must filter their rows
            accordingly.
        n_rows
            Maximum number of rows requested from the scan. cudf-polars does not
            support a pushed-down row limit and rejects it during translation, so
            this is always ``None`` on a GPU engine (see
            https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/22918). It may be non-None
            on the default Polars CPU engine, where the source must honor it.
        batch_size
            Optional hint for the number of rows to yield per chunk.
        rank
            Rank running this scan function, bound by the streaming engine.
            Defaults to ``0`` for single-rank / in-memory / default
            Polars-engine execution.
        nranks
            Total number of ranks (the world size), bound by the streaming
            engine. Defaults to ``1`` for single-rank execution.

        Returns
        -------
        Chunks for this rank. Return a :class:`SizedChunks` if the total chunk count
        is known upfront to enable lazy streaming.

        Notes
        -----
        Returning one or more `cudf_polars.containers.DataFrame` objects restricts
        the source to cudf-polars engines. To support the default (host) Polars engine,
        an IO source should only return :class:`polars.DataFrame`.

        The emitted columns, after applying `with_columns`, must match the registered
        schema in name, order, and dtype. cudf-polars always validates this and raises
        :class:`polars.exceptions.SchemaError` on mismatch. Polars only performs this
        validation when `register_io_source(validate_schema=True)` is used, but that
        flag is not exposed to the GPU execution path.
