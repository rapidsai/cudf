    Reserve memory, recording the wait as a Quent event.

    This is a drop-in replacement for
    :func:`rapidsmpf.streaming.core.memory_reserve_or_wait.reserve_memory` for
    the reservations made on behalf of an IR node. The reservation is recorded
    as a Quent Task bound to that node's operator, so a trace shows which
    operators are waiting on memory admission and for how much.

    Parameters
    ----------
    context
        The rapidsmpf context.
    size
        The number of bytes to reserve.
    net_memory_delta
        The expected lasting change in memory usage. This is smaller than
        ``size`` for operations whose peak usage is transient.
    ir_context
        The execution context for the IR node making the reservation, which
        supplies the Quent operator the reservation is attributed to. ``None``
        for a reservation that can't be attributed to an IR node, in which
        case nothing is recorded.
    purpose
        What the memory is reserved for (e.g. ``"scan"``). Distinguishes
        reservations made by a single operator.
    sequence_number
        The sequence number of the chunk this reservation is for, if any.
    mem_type
        The memory tier to reserve from.
    allow_overbooking
        Whether the runtime may hand out a reservation it cannot back, or
        ``None`` to use the rapidsmpf default.

    Returns
    -------
    The satisfied memory reservation.

    Notes
    -----
    Nothing is recorded unless the query is being traced, in which case this
    behaves exactly like ``reserve_memory``.
