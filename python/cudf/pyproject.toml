#
#   rmm-cu12 [cuda_suffixed = "true"]

#
# So it's possible to separate the choices "use CUDA-suffixed names in wheel metadata"
# and "depend on different sets of libraries based on CUDA version".
#
# Setting matrix selector "cuda_suffixed=true" here tells rapids-build-backend that by default,
# it should produce wheels for redistribution which have CUDA-suffixed dependency names.
#
# This is intended to be overridden with --config-settings passed to 'pip wheel' or 'build'
# in environments which prefer all CUDA-suffix-less dependency names.
