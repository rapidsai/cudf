    If `data` isn't a buffer already, a new buffer that points to the memory of

    If `data` is owned by a spillable buffer, a "slice" of the buffer is

    device memory usage see `cudf.core.buffer.spill_manager.SpillManager`.
    Unspill is triggered automatically when accessing the data of the buffer.

    A buffer can be exposed permanently at creation or by accessing the `.ptr`
    property. To avoid this, one can use `.get_ptr()` instead, which support
    exposing the buffer temporarily.
