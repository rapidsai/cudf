    # Cython-generated C++ code will always include numerous intermediate
    # assignments that will prevent copy elision like you would see in the
    # equivalent C++ code. Moreover, this function must access a Python list
    # (of children) to construct the column_view, which means it cannot be
    # entirely nogil. The output of this function will be passed into libcudf
    # function calls that invariably happen inside nogil blocks, which
    # guarantees that the generated code will not be amenable to copy elision.
    # As such, this pointer-based approach is the only way to avoid a large
    # number of additional copies from being made.
