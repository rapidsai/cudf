"""Module used for global configuration of benchmarks.

This file contains global definitions that are important for configuring all
benchmarks such as fixture sizes. In addition, this file supports the following
features:
    - Defining the CUDF_BENCHMARKS_USE_PANDAS environment variable will change
      all benchmarks to run with pandas instead of cudf (and numpy instead of
      cupy). This feature enables easy comparisons of benchmarks between cudf
      and pandas. All common modules (cudf, cupy) should be imported from here
      by benchmark modules to allow configuration if needed.
    - Defining CUDF_BENCHMARKS_TEST_ONLY will set global configuration
      variables to avoid running large benchmarks, instead using minimal values
      to simply ensure that benchmarks are functional.

This file is also where standard pytest hooks should be overridden. While these
definitions typically belong in conftest.py, since any of the above environment
variables could affect test collection or other properties, we must define them
in this file and import them in conftest.py to ensure that they are handled
appropriately.
