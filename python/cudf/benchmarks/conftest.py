"""Standard location for shared fixtures and code across tests.

Most fixtures defined in this file represent one of the primary classes in the
cuDF ecosystem such as DataFrame, Series, or Index. These fixtures may in turn
be broken up into two categories: base fixtures and fixture unions. Each base
fixture represents a specific type of object as well as certain of its
properties crucial for benchmarking. Specifically, fixtures must account for
the following different parameters:
    - Class of object (DataFrame, Series, Index)
    - Dtype
    - Nullability
    - Size (rows for all, rows/columns for DataFrame)

One such fixture is a series of nullable integer data. Given that we generally
want data across different sizes, we parametrize all fixtures across different
numbers of rows rather than generating separate fixtures for each different
possible number of rows. The number of columns is only relevant for DataFrame.

While this core set of fixtures means that any benchmark can be run for any
combination of these parameters, it also means that we would effectively have
to parametrize our benchmarks with many fixtures. Not only is parametrizing
tests with fixtures in this manner unsupported by pytest, it is also an
inelegant solution leading to cumbersome parameter lists that must be
maintained across all tests. Instead we make use of the
`pytest_cases <https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-cases/>_` pytest plugin,
which supports the creation of fixture unions: fixtures that result from
combining other fixtures together. The result is a set of well-defined fixtures
that allow us to write benchmarks that naturally express the set of objects for
which they are valid, e.g. `def bench_sort_values(frame_or_index)`.

The generated fixtures are named according to the following convention:
`{classname}_dtype_{dtype}[_nulls_{true|false}][[_cols_{num_cols}]_rows_{num_rows}]`
where classname is one of the following: index, series, dataframe,
indexedframe, frame, frame_or_index. Note that in the case of indexes, to match
Series/DataFrame we simply set `classname=index` and rely on the
`dtype_{dtype}` component to delineate which index class is actually in use.

In addition to the above fixtures, we also provide the following more
specialized fixtures:
    - rangeindex: Since RangeIndex always holds int64 data we cannot conflate
      it with index_dtype_int64 (a true Int64Index), and it cannot hold nulls.
      As a result, it is provided as a separate fixture.
