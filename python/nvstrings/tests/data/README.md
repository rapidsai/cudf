These are some sample .csv files downloaded from https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/

The utf8.csv file is a copy of the 36634-rows.csv file with all the lowercase 'e' characters changed to 'Ã©' which is a 2-byte UTF-8 character (0xC3A9). This provides mix of 1 and 2 byte characters in the same string which would be common in most Latin based languages.
