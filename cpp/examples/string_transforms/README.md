# libcudf C++ examples using string transforms

This C++ example demonstrates using libcudf transform API to access and create
strings columns.

The example source code loads a csv file and produces a transformed column from the table using the values from the tables.

The following examples are included:
1. `localize_phone_jit` - Using a transform to branch on input columns and returning string values
2. `localize_phone_precompiled` - Performs same transformation on the table as `branching` but uses precompiled public APIs
3. `compute_checksum_jit` - Using a transform to perform a fused checksum on two columns
4. `extract_email_jit` - Using a transform to get a substring from a kernel
5. `extract_email_precompiled` - Performs same transformation on the table as `output` but uses precompiled public APIs
6. `format_phone_jit` - Using a transform kernel to output a string to a pre-allocated buffer
7. `format_phone_precompiled` - Performs same transformation on the table as `preallocated` but uses precompiled public APIs

## Compile and execute

```bash
# Configure project
cmake -S . -B build/
# Build
cmake --build build/ --parallel $PARALLEL_LEVEL
# Execute
build/output info.csv output.csv 100000
```

If your machine does not come with a pre-built libcudf binary, expect the
first build to take some time, as it would build libcudf on the host machine.
It may be sped up by configuring the proper `PARALLEL_LEVEL` number.
