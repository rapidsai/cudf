# "tpch" Benchmarks for `libcudf`

## Disclaimer

"tpch" is derived from the TPC-H Benchmarks and as such any results obtained using "tpch" are not
comparable to published TPC-H Benchmark results, as the results obtained from using "tpch" do not
comply with the TPC-H Benchmarks.

## Current Status

For now, only Q1, Q5, Q6, Q9, and Q10 have been implemented
