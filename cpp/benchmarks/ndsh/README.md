## Disclaimer

NDS-H is derived from the TPC-H Benchmarks and as such any results obtained using NDS-H are not
comparable to published TPC-H Benchmark results, as the results obtained from using NDS-H do not
comply with the TPC-H Benchmarks.

## Current Status

For now, only Q1, Q5, Q6, Q9, and Q10 have been implemented
