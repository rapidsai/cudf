/**
 * @brief  This class serves as a wrapper for using `cudaEvent_t` as the user
 * defined timer within the framework of google benchmark
 * (https://github.com/google/benchmark).
 *
 * It is built on top of the idea of Resource acquisition is initialization
 * (RAII). In the following we show a minimal example of how to use this class.

    #include <benchmark/benchmark.h>

    static void sample_cuda_benchmark(benchmark::State& state) {

      for (auto _ : state){

        rmm::cuda_stream_view stream{}; // default stream, could be another stream

        // Create (Construct) an object of this class. You HAVE to pass in the
        // benchmark::State object you are using. It measures the time from its
        // creation to its destruction that is spent on the specified CUDA stream.
        // It also clears the L2 cache by cudaMemset'ing a device buffer that is of
        // the size of the L2 cache (if flush_l2_cache is set to true and there is
        // an L2 cache on the current device).
        cuda_event_timer raii(state, true, stream); // flush_l2_cache = true

        // Now perform the operations that is to be benchmarked
        sample_kernel<<<1, 256, 0, stream.value()>>>(); // Possibly launching a CUDA kernel

      }
    }

    // Register the function as a benchmark. You will need to set the `UseManualTime()`
    // flag in order to use the timer embedded in this class.
