/**
 * @brief The size used for padding a data buffer's size to a multiple of the padding.
 *
 * Padding is necessary for input/output buffers of several compression/decompression kernels
 * (inflate_kernel and nvcomp snappy). Such kernels operate on aligned data pointers, which require
 * padding to the buffers so that the pointers can shift along the address space to satisfy their
 * alignment requirement.
 *
 * In the meantime, it is not entirely clear why such padding is needed. We need to further
 * investigate and implement a better fix rather than just padding the buffer.
 * See https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/13605.
