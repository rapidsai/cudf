/**
 * @brief AVRO file metadata struct
 *
 * `metadata_size` is the size in bytes of the avro file header.
 *
 * `total_data_size` is the size of all data minus `metadata_size`.
 *
 * `selected_data_size` is the size of all data minus `metadata_size`, with any
 * adjustments made to account for the number of rows or rows to skip per the
 * user's request.  This is the value used to size device-side buffers.
 *
 * `num_rows` is the number of rows that will be processed.  If the user has not
 * requested the number of rows to be limited (i.e. via the `num_rows` param to
 * `read_avro()`), this number will represent all rows in the file *after* the
 * `skip_rows` parameter has been taken into consideration (assuming a request
 * has been made to also skip rows).
 *
 * `total_num_rows` is the total number of rows present in the file, across all
 * blocks.  This may be more than `num_rows` if the user has requested a limit
 * on the number of rows to return, or if `skip_rows` is active.
 *
 * `skip_rows` is the number of rows the user has requested to skip.  Note that
 * this value may differ from the `block_desc_s.first_row` member, which will
 * capture the number of rows to skip for a given block.
 *
 * `block_list` is a list of all blocks that contain the selected rows.  If no
 * row filtering has been done via `num_rows` or `skip_rows`; it will contain
 * all blocks.  Otherwise, it will contain only blocks selected by those
 * constraints.
 *
 * N.B. It is important to note that the coordination of skipping and limiting
 *      rows is dictated by the `first_row` and `num_rows` members of each block
 *      in the block list, *not* the `skip_rows` and `num_rows` members of this
 *      struct.
 *
 *      This is because the first row and number of rows to process for each
 *      block needs to be handled at the individual block level in order to
 *      correctly support avro multi-block files.
 *
 *      See also the `block_desc_s` struct.
