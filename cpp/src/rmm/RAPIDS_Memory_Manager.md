# Memory Management in RAPIDS with RMM

RAPIDS Memory Manager (RMM) is:

 - A replacement allocator for CUDA Device Memory.
 - A pool allocator to make CUDA device memory allocation / deallocation faster
   and asynchronous.
 - A central place for all device memory allocations in cuDF (C++ and Python).

RMM is not:
 - A replacement allocator for CUDA managed memory (Unified Memory, 
   e.g. `cudaMallocManaged`). This may change in the future.
 - A replacement allocator for host memory (`malloc`, `new`, `cudaMallocHost`, 
   `cudaHostRegister`).

## Using RMM in C/C++ code

Using RMM in CUDA C++ code is straightforward. Include `rmm.h` and replace calls
to `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()` with calls to the `RMM_ALLOC()` and 
`RMM_FREE()` macros, respectively. 

Note that `RMM_ALLOC` and `RMM_FREE` take an additional parameter, a stream 
identifier. This is necessary to enable asynchronous allocation and 
deallocation; however, the default (also known as null) stream (or `0`) can be
used. For example:

```
// old
CUDA_TRY( cudaMalloc(&myvar, size_in_bytes) );
// ...
CUDA_TRY( cudaFree(myvar) );

// new
RMM_TRY( RMM_ALLOC((void**)&myvar, size_in_bytes, stream_id) );
// ...
RMM_TRY( RMM_FREE(myvar, stream_id) );
```

`RMM_TRY` is a macro equivalent to `CUDA_TRY`. It returns a GDF error code if 
the RMM function fails.

Note that `RMM_ALLOC` and `RMM_FREE` are wrappers around `rmmAlloc()` and
`rmmFree()`, respectively. The lower-level functions also take a file name and
a line number for tracking the location of RMM allocations and deallocations. 
The macro versions use the preprocessor to automatically specify these params. 

### Using RMM with Thrust

libcudf makes heavy use of Thrust. Thrust uses CUDA device memory in two 
situations:

 1. As the backing store for `thrust::device_vector`, and
 2. As temporary storage inside some algorithms, such as `thrust::sort`.

libcudf now includes a custom Thrust allocator in the file 
`thrust_rmm_allocator.h`. This defines the template class `rmm_allocator`, and 
a custom Thrust CUDA device execution policy called `rmm::exec_policy(stream)`.
This instructs Thrust to use RMM for temporary memory allocation and execute on 
the specified `stream`.

#### Thrust Device Vectors

Instead of creating device vectors like this:

```
thrust::device_vector<size_type> permuted_indices(column_length);
```

You can tell Thrust to use `rmm_allocator` like this:

```
thrust::device_vector<size_type, rmm_allocator<T>> permuted_indices(column_length);
```

For convenience, you can use the alias `rmm::device_vector<T>` defined in 
`thrust_rmm_allocator.h` that can be used as if it were a `thrust::device_vector<T>`. 

#### Thrust Algorithms

To instruct Thrust to use RMM to allocate temporary storage, you can use the custom
Thrust CUDA device execution policy: `rmm::exec_policy(stream)`. This instructs 
Thrust to use RMM for temporary memory allocation and execute on the specified `stream`.

Example usage:
```
thrust::sort(rmm::exec_policy(stream), ...);
```

## Using RMM in Python Code

cuDF and other Python libraries typically create arrays of CUDA device memory
by using Numba's `cuda.device_array` interfaces. Until Numba provides a plugin
interface for using an external memory manager, RMM provides an API compatible
with `cuda.device_array` constructors that cuDF (also cuDF C++ API pytests) 
should use to ensure all CUDA device memory is allocated via the memory manager.
RMM provides:

   - `librmm.device_array()`
   - `librmm.device_array_like()`
   - `librmm.to_device()`
   - `librmm.auto_device()`
   
Which are compatible with their Numba `cuda.*` equivalents. They return a Numba 
NDArray object whose memory is allocated in CUDA device memory using RMM.

Following is an example from cuDF `groupby.py` that copies from a numpy array to 
an equivalent CUDA `device_array` using `to_device()`, and creates a device 
array using `device_array`, and then runs a Numba kernel (`group_mean`) to 
compute the output values.

```
    ...
    dev_begins = rmm.to_device(np.asarray(begin))
    dev_out = rmm.device_array(size, dtype=np.float64)
    if size > 0:
        group_mean.forall(size)(sr.to_gpu_array(),
                                dev_begins,
                                dev_out)
    values[newk] = dev_out
```
In another example from cuDF `cudautils.py`, `fillna` uses `device_array_like` 
to construct a CUDA device array with the same shape and data type as another.

```
def fillna(data, mask, value):
    out = rmm.device_array_like(data)
    out.copy_to_device(data)
    configured = gpu_fill_masked.forall(data.size)
    configured(value, mask, out)
    return out
```

`librmm` also provides `get_ipc_handle()` for getting the IPC handle associated 
with a Numba NDArray, which accounts for the case where the data for the NDArray
is suballocated from some larger pool allocation by the memory manager.

To use librmm NDArray functions you need to import librmm like this:

`from librmm_cffi import librmm` or
`from librmm_cffi import librmm as rmm`

### Handling RMM Options in Python Code

RMM currently defaults to just calling cudaMalloc, but you can enable the 
experimental pool allocator using the `librmm_config` module. 

```
from librmm_cffi import librmm_config as rmm_cfg

rmm_cfg.use_pool_allocator = True # default is False
rmm_cfg.initial_pool_size = 2<<30 # set to 2GiB. Default is 1/2 total GPU memory
rmm_cfg.enable_logging = True     # default is False -- has perf overhead
```

To configure RMM options to be used in cuDF before loading, simply do the above 
before you `import cudf`. You can re-initialize the memory manager with 
different settings at run time by calling `librmm.finalize()`, then changing the
above options, and then calling `librmm.initialize()`.

You can also optionally use the internal functions in cuDF which call these 
functions. Here are some example configuration functions that can be used in 
a notebook to initialize the memory manager in each Dask worker.

```
from librmm_cffi import librmm_config as rmm_cfg

def initialize_rmm_pool():
    pygdf._gdf.rmm_finalize()
    rmm_cfg.use_pool_allocator = True
    return pygdf._gdf.rmm_initialize()

def initialize_rmm_no_pool():
    pygdf._gdf.rmm_finalize()
    rmm_cfg.use_pool_allocator = False
    return pygdf._gdf.rmm_initialize()

def finalize_rmm():
    return pygdf._gdf.rmm_finalize()
```

Given the above, typically you would initialize RMM in the notebook process to
not use the pool `initialize_rmm_no_pool()`, and then run 
`client.run(initialize_rmm_pool) to initialize a memory pool in each worker
process.

Remember that while the pool is in use memory is not freed. So if you follow 
cuDF operations with device-memory-intensive computations that don't use RMM
(such as XGBoost), you will need to move the data to the host and then 
finalize RMM. The Mortgage E2E workflow notebook uses this technique. We are 
working on better ways to reclaim memory, as well as making RAPIDS machine
learning libraries use the same RMM memory pool.
