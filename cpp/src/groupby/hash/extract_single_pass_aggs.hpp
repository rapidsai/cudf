/**
 * @brief Extract single pass aggregations from the given aggregation requests.
 *
 * During extraction, compound aggregations will be replaced by their corresponding single pass
 * aggregations dependencies. For example, a MEAN aggregation will be replaced by a SUM and a
 * COUNT_VALID aggregation.
 *
 * For some single-pass aggregations, we also try to reduce overhead by forcing their results
 * columns to be non-nullable. For example, a SUM aggregation needed only as the intermediate result
 * for M2 aggregation will not need to have a nullmask to avoid the extra nullmask update and null
 * count computation overhead.
 *
 * @param requests The aggregation requests
 * @param stream The CUDA stream
 *
 * @return A tuple containing:
 *         - A table_view containing the input values columns for the single-pass aggregations,
 *         - A vector of aggregation kinds corresponding to each of these values columns,
 *         - A vector of aggregation objects corresponding to each of these values columns,
 *         - A vector of binary values indicating if the corresponding result will be forced to be
 *           non-nullable, and
 *         - A boolean value indicating if there are any multi-pass (compound) aggregations.
