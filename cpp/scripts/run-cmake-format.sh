# This script is a wrapper for cmakelang that may be used with pre-commit. The
# wrapping is necessary because RAPIDS libraries split configuration for
# cmakelang linters between a local config file and a second config file that's
# shared across all of RAPIDS via rapids-cmake. In order to keep it up to date
# this file is only maintained in one place (the rapids-cmake repo) and
# pulled down during builds. We need a way to invoke CMake linting commands
# without causing pre-commit failures (which could block local commits or CI),
# while also being sufficiently flexible to allow users to maintain the config
# file independently of a build directory.
#
# This script provides the minimal functionality to enable those use cases. It
# searches in a number of predefined locations for the rapids-cmake config file
# and exits gracefully if the file is not found. If a user wishes to specify a
# config file at a nonstandard location, they may do so by setting the
# environment variable RAPIDS_CMAKE_FORMAT_FILE.
#
# This script can be invoked directly anywhere within the project repository.
# Alternatively, it may be invoked as a pre-commit hook via
# `pre-commit run (cmake-format)|(cmake-lint)`.
#
# Usage:
# bash run-cmake-format.sh {cmake-format,cmake-lint} infile [infile ...]
