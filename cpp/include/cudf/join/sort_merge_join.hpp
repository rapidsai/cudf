   * @brief Performs an inner join between a partition of the left table and the right table.

   * This method executes an inner join operation between a specific partition of the left table

   * while maintaining consistent results as if the entire join was performed at once. This is
   * particularly useful for handling large datasets that would otherwise exceed available memory
   * resources.
   *
   * The returned indices can be used to construct the join result for this partition. The
   * left_indices are relative to the original complete left table (not just the partition), so they
