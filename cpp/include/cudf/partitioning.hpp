/**
 * @brief Partitions rows of `t` according to the mapping specified by
 * `partition_map`.
 *
 * For each row at `i` in `t`, `partition_map[i]` indicates which partition row
 * `i` belongs to. `partition` creates a new table by rearranging the rows of
 * `t` such that rows in the same partition are contiguous. The returned table
 * is in ascending partition order from `[0, num_partitions)`. The order within
 * each partition is undefined.
 *
 * Returns a `vector<size_type>` of `num_partitions + 1` values that indicate
 * the starting position of each partition within the returned table, i.e.,
 * partition `i` starts at `offsets[i]` (inclusive) and ends at `offset[i+1]`
 * (exclusive). As a result, if value `j` in `[0, num_partitions)` does not
 * appear in `partition_map`, partition `j` will be empty, i.e.,
 * `offsets[j+1] - offsets[j] == 0`.
 *
 * Values in `partition_map` must be in the range `[0, num_partitions)`,
 * otherwise behavior is undefined.
 *
 * @throw cudf::logic_error when `partition_map` is a non-integer type
 * @throw cudf::logic_error when `partition_map.has_nulls() == true`

/**
 * @brief Round-robin partition.
 *
 * Returns a new table with rows re-arranged into partition groups and
 * a vector of row offsets to the start of each partition in the output table.
 * Rows are assigned partitions based on their row index in the table,
 * in a round robin fashion.

 *
 * A good analogy for the algorithm is dealing out cards:
 *
 *  1. The deck of cards is represented as the rows in the table.
 *  2. The number of partitions is the number of players being dealt cards.
 *  3. the start_partition indicates which player starts getting cards first.
 *
 * The algorithm has two outcomes:
 *
 *  1. Another deck of cards formed by stacking each
 *      player's cards back into a deck again,
 *      preserving the order of cards dealt to each player,
 *      starting with player 0.
 *  2. A vector into the output deck indicating where a player's cards start.
 *
 * A player's deck (partition) is the range of cards starting
 * at the corresponding offset and ending at the next player's
 * starting offset or the last card in the deck if it's the last player.
 *
 * When num_partitions > nrows, we have more players than cards.
 * We start dealing to the first indicated player and continuing
 * around the players until we run out of cards before we run out of players.
 * Players that did not get any cards are represented by
 * `offset[i] == offset[i+1] or
 * offset[i] == table.num_rows() if i == num_partitions-1`
 * meaning there are no cards (rows) in their deck (partition).
