 * Support all GDF data types except for GDF_CATEGORY or GDF_STRING.
 * For GDF_STRING_CATEGORY the UDF is only applied to the indices, after
 * which the underlying category is cleared and remapped.
 *
 * @param input               The input column to transform
 * @param unary_udf           The PTX/CUDA string of the unary function to apply
 * @param outout_type         The output type that is compatible with the output type in the PTX code
 * @param is_ptx              If true the UDF is treated as a piece of PTX code; if fasle the UDF is treated as a piece of CUDA code
 * @return gdf_column         The column resulting from applying the unary function to
