 * @brief Regenerates the special case mapping tables used to handle non-trivial unicode
 * character case conversions.
 * 
 * 'special' cased characters are those defined as not having trivial single->single character
 * mappings when having upper(), lower() or titlecase() operations applied.  Typically this is
 * for cases where a single character maps to multiple, but there are also cases of
 * non-reversible mappings, where:  codepoint != lower(upper(code_point)).
