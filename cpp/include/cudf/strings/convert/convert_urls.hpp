/**
 * @brief Encodes each string using URL encoding.
 *
 * Converts all character sequences starting with '%' into character code-points
 * interpreting the 2 following characters as hex values to create the code-point.
 * For example, the sequence '%20' is converted into byte (0x20) which is a single
 * space character. Another example converts '%C3%A9' into 2 sequential bytes
 * (0xc3 and 0xa9 respectively) which is the é character. Overall, 3 characters
 * are converted into one char byte whenever a '%%' (single percent) character
 * is encountered in the string.
 *
 * Any null entries will result in corresponding null entries in the output column.
 *
 * @param strings Strings instance for this operation.
 * @param mr Device memory resource used to allocate the returned column's device memory.
