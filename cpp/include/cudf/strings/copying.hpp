/**
 * @brief Returns a new strings column created from a subset of
 * of the strings column. The subset of strings selected is between
 * start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) with increments of step.
 *
 * @code{.pseudo}
 * Example:
 * s1 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
 * s2 = slice( s1, 2 )
 * s2 is ["c", "d", "e", "f"]
 * s3 = slice( s1, 1, 2 )
 * s3 is ["b", "d", "f"]
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param strings Strings instance for this operation.
 * @param start Index to first string to select in the column (inclusive).
 * @param end Index to last string to select in the column (exclusive).
 *            Default -1 indicates the last element.
 * @param step Increment value between indices.
 *             Default step is 1.
 * @param stream CUDA stream used for device memory operations and kernel launches.
 * @param mr Device memory resource used to allocate the returned column's device memory.
 * @return New strings column of size (end-start)/step.
