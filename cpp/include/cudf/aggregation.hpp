 *
 * EWMA aggregations are parameterized by a center of mass (`com`) which
 * affects the contribution of the previous values (y_0 ... y_{i-1}) in
 * computing the y_i.
 *
 * EWMA aggregations are also parameterized by a history `cudf::ewm_history`.
 * Special considerations have to be given to the mathematical treatment of
 * the first value of the input sequence. There are two approaches to this,
 * one which considers the first value of the sequence to be the exponential
 * weighted moving average of some infinite history of data, and one which
 * takes the first value to be the only datapoint known. These assumptions
 * lead to two different formulas for the y_i. `ewm_history` selects which.
 *
 * EWMA aggregations have special null handling. Nulls have two effects. The
 * first is to propagate forward the last valid value as far as it has been
 * computed. This could be thought of as the nulls not affecting the average
 * in any way. The second effect changes the way the y_i are computed. Since
 * a moving average is conceptually designed to weight contributing values by
 * their recency, nulls ought to count as valid periods even though they do
 * not change the average. For example, if the input sequence is {1, NULL, 3}
 * then when computing y_2 one should weigh y_0 as if it occurs two periods
 * before y_2 rather than just one.

/**
 * @brief Factory to create a RANK aggregation
 *
 * `RANK` returns a column of size_type or double "ranks" (see note 3 below for how the
 * data type is determined) for a given rank method and column order.
 * If nulls are excluded, the rank will be null for those rows, otherwise a non-nullable column is
 * returned. Double precision column is returned only when percentage!=NONE and when rank method is
 * average.
 *
 * This aggregation only works with "scan" algorithms. The input column into the group or
 * ungrouped scan is an orderby column that orders the rows that the aggregate function ranks.
 * If rows are ordered by more than one column, the orderby input column should be a struct
 * column containing the ordering columns.
 *
 * Note:
 *  1. This method could work faster with the rows that are presorted by the group keys and order_by
 *     columns. Though groupby object does not require order_by column to be sorted, groupby rank
 *     scan aggregation does require the order_by column to be sorted if the keys are sorted.
 *  2. `RANK` aggregations are not compatible with exclusive scans.
 *  3. All rank methods except AVERAGE method and percentage!=NONE returns size_type column.
 *     For AVERAGE method and percentage!=NONE, the return type is double column.
 *
 * @code{.pseudo}
 * Example: Consider a motor-racing statistics dataset, containing the following columns:
 *   1. venue:  (STRING) Location of the race event
 *   2. driver: (STRING) Name of the car driver (abbreviated to 3 characters)
 *   3. time:   (INT32)  Time taken to complete the circuit
 *
 * For the following presorted data:
 *
 *  [ //      venue,           driver,           time
 *    {   "silverstone",  "HAM" ("hamilton"),   15823},
 *    {   "silverstone",  "LEC" ("leclerc"),    15827},
 *    {   "silverstone",  "BOT" ("bottas"),     15834},  // <-- Tied for 3rd place.
 *    {   "silverstone",  "NOR" ("norris"),     15834},  // <-- Tied for 3rd place.

 *  ]
 *

 *
 * This aggregation is designed specifically to merge the partial results of multiple (distributed)
 * groupby `COLLECT_LIST` or `COLLECT_SET` aggregations into a final `COLLECT_SET` result. As such,
 * it requires the input lists column to be non-nullable (the child column containing list entries
 * is not subjected to this requirement).
 *
 * In practice, the input (partial results) to this aggregation should be generated by (distributed)
 * `COLLECT_LIST` aggregations, not `COLLECT_SET`, to avoid unnecessarily removing duplicate entries
 * for the partial results.
 *
 * @param nulls_equal Flag to specify whether nulls within each list should be considered equal
 *        during dropping duplicate list entries.
 * @param nans_equal Flag to specify whether NaN values in floating point column should be
 *        considered equal during dropping duplicate list entries.
 * @return A MERGE_SETS aggregation object
