 * `RANK` returns a column of size_type or double "ranks" (see note 3 below for how the

 * If nulls are excluded, the rank will be null for those rows, otherwise a non-nullable column is
 * returned. Double precision column is returned only when percentage!=NONE and when rank method is
 * average.
 *
 * This aggregation only works with "scan" algorithms. The input column into the group or
 * ungrouped scan is an orderby column that orders the rows that the aggregate function ranks.
 * If rows are ordered by more than one column, the orderby input column should be a struct
 * column containing the ordering columns.
 *
 * Note:
 *  1. This method could work faster with the rows that are presorted by the group keys and order_by
 *     columns. Though groupby object does not require order_by column to be sorted, groupby rank
 *     scan aggregation does require the order_by column to be sorted if the keys are sorted.
 *  2. `RANK` aggregations are not compatible with exclusive scans.
 *  3. All rank methods except AVERAGE method and percentage!=NONE returns size_type column.
 *     For AVERAGE method and percentage!=NONE, the return type is double column.
 *
 * @code{.pseudo}
 * Example: Consider a motor-racing statistics dataset, containing the following columns:
 *   1. venue:  (STRING) Location of the race event
 *   2. driver: (STRING) Name of the car driver (abbreviated to 3 characters)
 *   3. time:   (INT32)  Time taken to complete the circuit
 *
 * For the following presorted data:
 *
 *  [ //      venue,           driver,           time
 *    {   "silverstone",  "HAM" ("hamilton"),   15823},
 *    {   "silverstone",  "LEC" ("leclerc"),    15827},
 *    {   "silverstone",  "BOT" ("bottas"),     15834},  // <-- Tied for 3rd place.

 *  ]
 *

 * average: {   1,     2,   3.5,   3.5,     5,      1,   2.5,   2.5,     4,     5}

 * max:     {   1,     2,     4,     4,     5,      1,     3,     3,     4,     5}

 *   double       // min
 *   double       // max
 * }
 *

 * tdigest, each element of which represents a weighted centroid (mean, weight).
 *
 * @param max_centroids Parameter controlling compression level and accuracy on subsequent
 * queries on the output tdigest data.  `max_centroids` places an upper bound on the size of
 * the computed tdigests: A value of 1000 will result in a tdigest containing no
 * more than 1000 centroids (32 bytes each). Higher result in more accurate tdigest information.
