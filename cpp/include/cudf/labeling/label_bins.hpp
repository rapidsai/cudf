/**
 * @brief Labels elements based on membership in the specified bins.
 *
 * A bin `i` is defined by `left_edges[i], right_edges[i]`. Whether the edges are inclusive or
 * not is determined by `left_inclusive` and `right_inclusive`, respectively.
 *
 * A value `input[j]` belongs to bin `i` if `value[j]` is contained in the range `left_edges[i],
 * right_edges[i]` (with the specified inclusiveness) and `label[j] == i`. If  `input[j]` does not
 * belong to any bin, then `label[j]` is NULL.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - If an empty set of edges is provided, all elements in `input` are labeled NULL.
 *   - NULL elements in `input` belong to no bin and their corresponding label is NULL.
 *   - NaN elements in `input` belong to no bin and their corresponding label is NULL.
 *   - Bins must be provided in monotonically increasing order, otherwise behavior is undefined.
 *   - If two or more bins overlap, behavior is undefined.
 *
 * @throws cudf::logic_error if `input.type() == left_edges.type() == right_edges.type()` is
 * violated.
 * @throws cudf::logic_error if `left_edges.size() != right_edges.size()`
 * @throws cudf::logic_error if `left_edges.has_nulls()` or `right_edges.has_nulls()`
 *
 * @param input The input elements to label according to the specified bins.
 * @param left_edges Values of the left edge of each bin.
 * @param left_inclusive Whether or not the left edge is inclusive.
 * @param right_edges Value of the right edge of each bin.
 * @param right_inclusive Whether or not the right edge is inclusive.
 * @param edge_null_precedence Whether nulls in left and right edges are at the beginning or the
 * end.
 * @param mr Device memory resource used to allocate the returned column's device.
 * @return The integer labels of the elements in `input` according to the specified bins.
