 * @brief Rebinds column's device buffers to use `stream` for deallocation.
 *
 * Recursively updates the deallocation stream on the column's data buffers, null masks,
 * and all child columns. Does not copy device memory or launch kernels.
 *
 * @note This function does not insert CUDA cross-stream ordering. The caller must ensure a
 * happens-before relationship from every stream that may still have in-flight work touching
 * this column's device memory to @p stream (for example `cudf::detail::join_streams` after
 * parallel work on a stream pool, or explicit events / synchronization).
 *
 * @note `column_view` instances (including nested child views) that already referenced @p col's
 * device data remain valid: no device memory is copied or relocated, so their pointers and
 * metadata still describe the same buffers now owned by the returned column.
 *
 * @param col Column to rebind; ownership is transferred from this rvalue
 * @param stream Stream used for future asynchronous deallocation of the buffers
 * @return Column with equivalent contents and rebinding applied
