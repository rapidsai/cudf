# Unit Testing in libcudf

Unit tests in libcudf are written using 
[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md).

**Important:** Instead of including `gtest/gtest.h` directly, use 
`#include <cudf_test/cudf_gtest.hpp>`.

## Best Practices: What Should We Test?

In general we should test to make sure all code paths are covered. This is not always easy or 
possible. But generally this means we test all supported combinations of algorithms and data types,
and all operators supported by algorithms that support multiple operators (e.g. reductions, 
groupby).  Here are some other guidelines.

 * In general empty input is not an error in libcudf. Typically empty input results in empty output.
   Tests should verify this.

 * Anything that involves manipulating bitmasks (especially hand-rolled kernels) should have tests 
   that check varying number of rows, especially around boundaries like the warp size (32). So, test
   fewer than 32 rows, more than 32 rows, exactly 32 rows, and greater than 64 rows.

 * Most algorithms should have one or more tests exercising inputs with a large enough number of 
   rows to require launching multiple thread blocks, especially when values are ultimately 
   communicated between blocks (e.g. reductions). This is especially important for custom kernels 
   but also applies to Thrust and CUB algorithm calls with lambdas / functors. 

 * For anything involving strings or lists, test exhaustive combinations of empty strings/lists,
   null strings/lists and strings/lists with null elements. 
   
 * Strings tests should include a mixture of non-ASCII UTF-8 characters like `Ã©` in test data.

 * Test sliced columns as input (that is, columns that have a nonzero `offset`). This is an easy to
   forget case.

 * Tests that verify various forms of "degenerate" column inputs, for example: empty 
   string columns that have no children (not many paths in cudf can generate these but it 
   does happen); columns with zero size but that somehow have non-null data pointers; and struct 
   columns with no children.

 * Decimal types are not included in the `NumericTypes` type list, but are included in 
   `FixedWidthTypes`, so be careful that tests either include or exclude decimal types as 
   appropriate.


## Directory and File Naming

The naming of unit test directories and source files should be consistent with the feature being 
tested. For example, the tests for APIs in `copying.hpp` should live in `cudf/cpp/tests/copying`.
Each feature (or set of related features) should have its own test source file named 
`<feature>_tests.cu/cpp`. For example, `cudf/cpp/src/copying/scatter.cu` has tests in 
`cudf/cpp/tests/copying/scatter_tests.cu`.

In the interest of improving compile time, whenever possible, test source files should be `.cpp` 
files because `nvcc` is slower than `gcc` in compiling host code. Note that `thrust::device_vector`
includes device code, and so must only be used in `.cu` files. `rmm::device_uvector`, 
`rmm::device_buffer` and the various `column_wrapper` types described later can be used in `.cpp` 
files, and are therefore preferred in test code over `thrust::device_vector`.

## Base Fixture

All libcudf unit tests should make use of a GTest ["Test Fixture"](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md#test-fixtures-using-the-same-data-configuration-for-multiple-tests-same-data-multiple-tests).
Even if the fixture is empty, it should inherit from the base fixture `cudf::test::BaseFixture` 
found in `include/cudf_test/base_fixture.hpp`. This ensures that RMM is properly initialized and 
finalized. `cudf::test::BaseFixture` already inherits from `::testing::Test` and therefore it is 
not necessary for your test fixtures to inherit from it.

Example:
```c++
class MyTestFiture : public cudf::test::BaseFixture {...};
```

## Typed Tests

In general, libcudf features must work across all of the supported types (there are exceptions e.g.
not all binary operations are supported for all types). In order to automate the process of running
the same tests across multiple types, we use GTest's 
[Typed Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md#typed-tests).
Typed tests allow you to write a test once and run it across a list of types.

For example:
```c++
// Fixture must be a template
template <typename T>
class TypedTestFixture : cudf::test::BaseFixture {...};
using TestTypes = cudf::test:Types<int,float,double>; // Notice custom cudf type list type
TYPED_TEST_CASE(TypedTestFixture, TestTypes);
TYPED_TEST(TypedTestFixture, FirstTest){
    // Access the current type using `TypeParam`
    using T = TypeParam;
}
```

To specify the list of types to use, instead of GTest's `::testing::Types<...>`, libcudf provides `cudf::test::Types<...>` which is a custom, drop-in replacement for `::testing::Types`.
In this example, all tests using the `TypedTestFixture` fixture will run once for each type in the 
list defined in `TestTypes` (`int, float, double`).

### Type Lists

The list of types that are used in tests should be consistent across all tests. To ensure 
consistency, several sets of common type lists are provided in 
`include/cudf_test/type_lists.hpp`. For example, `NumericTypes` is a type list of all numeric types,
`FixedWidthTypes` is a list of all fixed-width element types, and `AllTypes` is a list of every 
element type that libcudf supports.

```c++
#include <cudf_test/type_lists.hpp>

// All tests using TypeTestFixture will be invoked once for each numeric type
TYPED_TEST_CASE(TypedTestFixture, cudf::test::NumericTypes);
```

Whenever possible, use one of the type list provided in `include/utilities/test/type_lists.hpp` 
rather than creating new custom lists.

#### Advanced Type Lists

Sometimes it is necessary to generate more advanced type lists than the simple lists of single types 
in the `TypeList` example above. libcudf provides a set of meta-programming utilities in 
`include/cudf_test/type_list_utilities.hpp` for generating and composing more advanced type lists.

For example, it may be useful to generate a *nested* type list where each element in the list is two
types. In a nested type list, each element in the list is itself another list. In order to access 
the `N`th type within the nested list, use `GetType<NestedList, N>`.

Imagine testing all possible two-type combinations of `<int,float>`. This could be done manually:

```c++
using namespace cudf::test;
template <typename TwoTypes>
TwoTypesFixture : BaseFixture{...};
using TwoTypesList = Types< Types<int, int>, Types<int, float>, 
                            Types<float, int>, Types<float, float> >;
TYPED_TEST_CASE(TwoTypesFixture, TwoTypesList);
TYPED_TEST(TwoTypesFixture, FirstTest){
    // TypeParam is a list of two types, i.e., a "nested" type list
    // Use `cudf::test::GetType` to retrieve the individual types
    using FirstType = GetType<TypeParam,0>;
    using SecondType = GetType<TypeParam,1>;
}
```

The above example manually specifies all pairs composed of `int` and `float`. `CrossProduct` is a 
utility in `type_list_utilities.hpp` which materializes this cross product automatically.

```c++
using TwoTypesList = Types< Types<int, int>, Types<int, float>, 
                            Types<float, int>, Types<float, float> >;
using CrossProductTypeList = CrossProduct< Types<int, float>, Types<int, float> >;
// TwoTypesList and CrossProductTypeList are identical
```

`CrossProduct` can be used with an arbitrary number of type lists to generate nested type lists of
two or more types. **However**, overuse of `CrossProduct` can dramatically inflate compile time. 
The cross product of two type lists of size `n` and `m` will result in a new list with 
`n*m` nested type lists. This means `n*m` templates will be instantiated; `n` and `m` need not be 
large before compile time becomes unreasonable.

There are a number of other utilities in `type_list_utilities.hpp`. For more details, see the 
documentation in that file and their associated tests in 
`cudf/cpp/tests/utilities_tests/type_list_tests.cpp`.

## Utilities

libcudf provides a number of utilities in `include/cudf_test` to make common testing operations more
convenient. Before creating your own test utilities, look to see if one already exists that does 
what you need. If not, consider adding a new utility to do what you need. However, make sure that 
the utility is generic enough to be useful for other tests and is not overly tailored to your 
specific testing need.

### Column Wrappers

In order to make generating input columns easier, libcudf provides the `*_column_wrapper` classes in
`include/cudf_test/column_wrapper.hpp`. These classes wrap a `cudf::column` and provide constructors
for initializing a `cudf::column` object usable with libcudf APIs. Any `*_column_wrapper` class is 
implicitly convertible to a `column_view` or `mutable_column_view` and therefore may be 
transparently passed to any API expecting a `column_view` or `mutable_column_view` argument.

#### `fixed_width_column_wrapper`

The `fixed_width_column_wrapper` class should be used for constructing and initializing columns of
any fixed-width element type, e.g., numeric types, timestamp types, Boolean, etc. 
`fixed_width_column_wrapper` provides constructors that accept an iterator range to generate each 
element in the column. For nullable columns, an additional iterator can be provided to indicate the 
validity of each element. There are also constructors that accept a `std::initializer_list<T>` for 
the column elements and optionally for the validity of each element.

Example:

```c++
// Creates a non-nullable column of INT32 elements with 5 elements: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
auto elements = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i;});
fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(elements, elements + 5);

// Creates a nullable column of INT32 elements with 5 elements: {null, 1, null, 3, null}
auto elements = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i;});
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;})
fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(elements, elements + 5, validity);

// Creates a non-nullable INT32 column with 4 elements: {1, 2, 3, 4}
fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> w{{1, 2, 3, 4}};

// Creates a nullable INT32 column with 4 elements: {1, NULL, 3, NULL}
fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> w{ {1,2,3,4}, {1, 0, 1, 0}};
```

#### `fixed_point_column_wrapper`

The `fixed_point_column_wrapper` class should be used for constructing and initializing columns of
any fixed-point element type (DECIMAL32 or DECIMAL64). `fixed_point_column_wrapper` provides 
constructors that accept an iterator range to generate each element in the column. For nullable 
columns, an additional iterator can be provided to indicate the validity of each element. 
Constructors also take the scale of the fixed-point values to create.

Example:
```c++
// Creates a non-nullable column of 4 DECIMAL32 elements of scale 3: {1000, 2000, 3000, 4000}
auto elements = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){ return i; });
fixed_point_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(elements, elements + 4, 3);

// Creates a nullable column of 5 DECIMAL32 elements of scale 2: {null, 100, null, 300, null}
auto elements = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){ return i; });
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){ return i%2; });
fixed_point_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(elements, elements + 5, validity, 2);
```

#### `dictionary_column_wrapper`

The `dictionary_column_wrapper` class should be used to create dictionary columns. 
`dictionary_column_wrapper` provides constructors that accept an iterator range to generate each 
element in the column. For nullable columns, an additional iterator can be provided to indicate the 
validity of each element. There are also constructors that accept a `std::initializer_list<T>` for 
the column elements and optionally for the validity of each element.

Example:
```c++
// Creates a non-nullable dictionary column of INT32 elements with 5 elements
// keys = {0, 2, 6}, indices = {0, 1, 1, 2, 2}
std::vector<int32_t> elements{0, 2, 2, 6, 6};
dictionary_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(element.begin(), elements.end());

// Creates a nullable dictionary column with 5 elements and a validity iterator.
std::vector<int32_t> elements{0, 2, 0, 6, 0};
// Validity iterator here sets even rows to null.
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;})
// keys = {2, 6}, indices = {NULL, 0, NULL, 1, NULL}
dictionary_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(elements, elements + 5, validity);

// Creates a non-nullable dictionary column with 4 elements.
// keys = {1, 2, 3}, indices = {0, 1, 2, 0}
dictionary_column_wrapper<int32_t> w{{1, 2, 3, 1}};

// Creates a nullable dictionary column with 4 elements and validity initializer.
// keys = {1, 3}, indices = {0, NULL, 1, NULL}
dictionary_column_wrapper<int32_t> w{ {1, 0, 3, 0}, {1, 0, 1, 0}};

// Creates a nullable column of dictionary elements with 5 elements and validity initializer.
std::vector<int32_t> elements{0, 2, 2, 6, 6};
// keys = {2, 6}, indices = {NULL, 0, NULL, 1, NULL}
dictionary_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> w(elements, elements + 5, {0, 1, 0, 1, 0});

// Creates a non-nullable dictionary column with 7 string elements
std::vector<std::string> strings{"", "aaa", "bbb", "aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "bbb"};
// keys = {"","aaa","bbb","ccc"}, indices = {0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2}
dictionary_column_wrapper<std::string> d(strings.begin(), strings.end());

// Creates a nullable dictionary column with 7 string elements and a validity iterator.
// Validity iterator here sets even rows to null.
// keys = {"a", "bb"}, indices = {NULL, 1, NULL, 1, NULL, 0, NULL}
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;});
dictionary_column_wrapper<std::string> d({"", "bb", "", "bb", "", "a", ""}, validity);
```

#### `strings_column_wrapper`

The `strings_column_wrapper` class should be used to create columns of strings. It provides 
constructors that accept an iterator range to generate each string in the column. For nullable 
columns, an additional iterator can be provided to indicate the validity of each string. There are 
also constructors that accept a `std::initializer_list<std::string>` for the column's strings and 
optionally for the validity of each element.

Example:
```c++
// Creates a non-nullable STRING column with 7 string elements: 
// {"", "this", "is", "a", "column", "of", "strings"}
std::vector<std::string> strings{"", "this", "is", "a", "column", "of", "strings"};
strings_column_wrapper s(strings.begin(), strings.end());

// Creates a nullable STRING column with 7 string elements: 
// {NULL, "this", NULL, "a", NULL, "of", NULL}
std::vector<std::string> strings{"", "this", "is", "a", "column", "of", "strings"};
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;});
strings_column_wrapper s(strings.begin(), strings.end(), validity);

// Creates a non-nullable STRING column with 7 string elements: 
// {"", "this", "is", "a", "column", "of", "strings"}
strings_column_wrapper s({"", "this", "is", "a", "column", "of", "strings"});

// Creates a nullable STRING column with 7 string elements: 
// {NULL, "this", NULL, "a", NULL, "of", NULL}
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;});
strings_column_wrapper s({"", "this", "is", "a", "column", "of", "strings"}, validity);
```

#### `lists_column_wrapper`

The `lists_column_wrapper` class should be used to create columns of lists. It provides 
constructors that accept an iterator range to generate each list in the column. For nullable 
columns, an additional iterator can be provided to indicate the validity of each list. There are 
also constructors that accept a `std::initializer_list<T>` for the column's lists and 
optionally for the validity of each element. A number of other constructors are available.

Example:
```c++
// Creates an empty LIST column
// []
lists_column_wrapper l{};

// Creates a LIST column with 1 list composed of 2 total integers
// [{0, 1}]
lists_column_wrapper l{0, 1};

// Creates a LIST column with 3 lists
// [{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}]
lists_column_wrapper l{ {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5} };

// Creates a LIST of LIST columns with 2 lists on the top level and
// 4 below
// [ {{0, 1}, {2, 3}}, {{4, 5}, {6, 7}} ]
lists_column_wrapper l{ {{0, 1}, {2, 3}}, {{4, 5}, {6, 7}} };

// Creates a LIST column with 1 list composed of 5 total integers
// [{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}]
auto elements = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i*2;});
lists_column_wrapper l(elements, elements+5);

// Creates a LIST column with 1 lists composed of 2 total integers
// [{0, NULL}]
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;});
lists_column_wrapper l{{0, 1}, validity};

// Creates a LIST column with 1 lists composed of 5 total integers
// [{0, NULL, 2, NULL, 4}]
auto elements = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i*2;});
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;});
lists_column_wrapper l(elements, elements+5, validity);

// Creates a LIST column with 1 list composed of 2 total strings
// [{"abc", "def"}]
lists_column_wrapper l{"abc", "def"};

// Creates a LIST of LIST columns with 2 lists on the top level and 4 below
// [ {{0, 1}, NULL}, {{4, 5}, NULL} ]
auto validity = make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){return i%2;});
lists_column_wrapper l{ {{{0, 1}, {2, 3}}, validity}, {{{4, 5}, {6, 7}}, validity} };
```

#### `structs_column_wrapper`

The `structs_column_wrapper` class should be used to create columns of structs. It provides 
constructors that accept a vector or initializer list of pre-constructed columns or column wrappers
for child columns. For nullable columns, an additional iterator can be provided to indicate the 
validity of each struct.

Examples:
```c++
// The following constructs a column for struct< int, string >.
auto child_int_col = fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t>{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }.release();
auto child_string_col = string_column_wrapper {"All", "the", "leaves", "are", "brown"}.release();

std::vector<std::unique_ptr<column>> child_columns;
child_columns.push_back(std::move(child_int_col));
child_columns.push_back(std::move(child_string_col));

struct_column_wrapper struct_column_wrapper{
  child_cols,
  {1,0,1,0,1} // Validity
};

auto struct_col {struct_column_wrapper.release()};
```

```c++
// The following constructs a column for struct< int, string >.
fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> child_int_col_wrapper{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
string_column_wrapper child_string_col_wrapper {"All", "the", "leaves", "are", "brown"};

struct_column_wrapper struct_column_wrapper{
  {child_int_col_wrapper, child_string_col_wrapper}
  {1,0,1,0,1} // Validity
};

auto struct_col {struct_column_wrapper.release()};
```

```c++
// The following constructs a column for struct< int, string >.
fixed_width_column_wrapper<int32_t> child_int_col_wrapper{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
string_column_wrapper child_string_col_wrapper {"All", "the", "leaves", "are", "brown"};

struct_column_wrapper struct_column_wrapper{
  {child_int_col_wrapper, child_string_col_wrapper}
  cudf::test::make_counting_transform_iterator(0, [](auto i){ return i%2; }) // Validity
};

auto struct_col {struct_column_wrapper.release()};
```

### Column Comparison Utilities

A common operation in testing is verifying that two columns are equal, or equivalent, or that they
have the same metadata.

#### `expect_column_properties_equal`

Verifies that two columns have the same type, size, and nullability. For nested types, recursively 
verifies the equality of type, size and nullability of all nested children.

#### `expect_column_properties_equivalent`

Verifies that two columns have equivalent type and equal size, ignoring nullability. For nested 
types, recursively verifies the equivalence of type, and equality of size of all nested children,
ignoring nullability.

Note "equivalent type". Most types are equivalent if and only they are equal. `fixed_point` types
are one exception. They are equivalent if the representation type is equal, even if they have 
different scales. Nested type columns can be equivalent in the case where they both have zero size, 
but one has children (also empty) and the other does not. For columns with nonzero size, both equals 
and equivalent expect equal number of children.

#### `expect_columns_equal`

Verifies that two columns have equal properties and verifies elementwise equality of the column 
data. Null elements are treated as equal.

#### `expect_columns_equivalent`

Verifies that two columns have equivalent properties and verifies elementwise equivalence of the 
column data. Null elements are treated as equivalent.

#### `expect_equal_buffers`

Verifies the bitwise equality of two device memory buffers.

### Printing and accessing column data

`include/cudf_test/column_utilities.hpp` defines various functions and overloads for printing 
columns (`print`), converting column data to string (`to_string`, `to_strings`), and copying data to
the host (`to_host).
