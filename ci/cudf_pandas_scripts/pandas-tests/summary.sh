# Aggregate the results of the sharded pandas-tests PR jobs.
#
# Each shard uploads its partial per-module summary as the GitHub artifact
# "pandas-test-pr-results-<shard_id>". This job downloads them all, merges them
# into a single pr-results.json, and posts the diff against the latest nightly
# ("main") results to the job summary.
#
# Usage:
#   summary.sh <num_shards>
#
# This step is purely informational, so it never fails the workflow; the
# pass/fail signal for the suite comes from the individual shard jobs.

# No `set -e`: this step is best effort and must never fail the workflow, so
# every fallible command is guarded explicitly and the script always exits 0.
