/**
 * Remaps keys to unique integer IDs.
 * <p>
 * Each distinct key in the build table is assigned a unique non-negative integer ID.
 * Rows with equal keys will map to the same ID. Keys that cannot be mapped (e.g., not found
 * in probe, or null keys when nulls are unequal) receive negative sentinel values.
 * The specific ID values are stable for the lifetime of this object but are otherwise unspecified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Ownership:</b> This class increments the reference counts on the columns from the provided
 * build keys table. The underlying column data is shared, not copied. When this object is closed,
 * it will decrement those reference counts. The original table passed to the constructor is not
 * affected and the caller retains ownership of it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For advanced memory management (e.g., spilling), use {@link #releaseBuildKeys()} to take
 * ownership of the internal build keys table. After calling this method, the caller is
 * responsible for ensuring the returned table remains valid for the lifetime of this object
 * and for closing it when appropriate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage pattern:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (KeyRemapping remap = new KeyRemapping(buildKeys, true)) {
 *   // Remap build keys (recomputes from cached build table)
 *   try (ColumnVector remappedBuild = remap.remapBuildKeys()) {
 *     // Remap probe keys
